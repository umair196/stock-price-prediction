## 📊 Dataset
Historical stock price data downloaded from Yahoo Finance.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn

## 🧠 Model Used
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)

## 📈 Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Scaling
4. Train-Test Split
5. LSTM Model Training
6. Prediction & Visualization

## 📊 Results
The model successfully predicts stock price trends with good accuracy on test data.
